## Project Summary

**Aegis** is autonomous gas reliability infrastructure for AI agents on Base. It observes blockchain state, reasons with an LLM, validates decisions through a policy engine, and executes gas sponsorships via account abstraction (ERC-4337). It implements agent-first prioritization (ERC-8004 > ERC-4337 > smart contracts; EOAs rejected), on-chain delegation with an audit trail, and a natural language command interface (OpenClaw).

- **Tech stack:** Next.js 16, TypeScript, Prisma/PostgreSQL, viem, Coinbase AgentKit, Vitest, Foundry
- **Contracts:** 3 deployed on Base Sepolia (AegisActivityLogger, AegisReactiveObserver, AegisDelegationRegistry)
- **819 commits** over 47 days (Jan 29 – Mar 16, 2026)
- **975 tests passing**, 0 failures

## How We Built Together

### Phase 0: Architecture & Core Agent (Jan 29 – Mar 12)

Victor designed the ORPEM (Observe-Reason-Policy-Execute-Memory) loop and Claude Code helped scaffold the full system:

- **Observation layer:** Blockchain state via viem, gas prices, treasury balances, oracle feeds, protocol budgets, Dune Analytics, and ERC-8004 identity lookups.
- **Reasoning engine:** Structured LLM output via Zod schemas. Claude helped design the `DecisionSchema` with confidence scores, preconditions, and expected outcomes.
- **Policy engine:** Safety-first rule chain — every decision passes through confidence, gas price, value cap, rate limit, whitelist, slippage, and sponsorship-specific rules. Claude wrote the fail-closed pattern for database-unavailable scenarios.
- **Execution:** Paymaster-based gas sponsorship with EIP-712 signed decisions, simulation mode, and circuit breakers. Claude authored the `signDecision` flow using viem's `hashMessage` and `privateKeyToAccount`.
- **Memory:** Prisma + Pinecone vector store for decision history and semantic retrieval.

Key AI-authored sections:
- `src/lib/agent/policy/sponsorship-rules.ts` — 12 ordered safety rules
- `src/lib/agent/execute/paymaster.ts` — decision signing + paymaster sponsorship
- `src/lib/agent/queue/` — priority queue with tier-based dequeue
- `src/lib/delegation/` — Zod schemas, service layer, and on-chain registry integration
- `src/lib/agent/openclaw/` — natural language command parser, rate limiter, confirmation flow

### Phase 1: Fix All 39 Failing Tests (Mar 16)

The test suite had 39 failures across 8 test files. Claude Code diagnosed and fixed every one:

| Root Cause | Files Affected | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)** — `vi.mock()` hoisted before `const` declarations | paymaster, sponsorship-policy, approved-agent-check, delegation-rules | Wrap mock vars with `vi.hoisted(() => vi.fn())` |
| **Missing mocks** — policy rules calling unmocked DB/services | sponsorship-policy, approved-agent-check, policy | Add mocks for `protocol/onboarding`, `runtime-overrides`, `gas-passport`, `lib/db` |
| **Timer hanging** — `sleep(20_000)` in Moltbook tests | moltbook-conversationalist (7 tests) | `vi.useFakeTimers()` + `advanceTimersByTimeAsync(100_000)` |
| **Field name mismatch** — `validFromMs`/`validUntilMs` renamed to `validFrom`/`validUntil` | delegation/service, delegation/schemas | Update test data to use ISO date strings |
| **Null crash** — `passport.sponsorCount` when passport is null | sponsorship-rules.ts (source bug) | Add `passport != null &&` guard |
| **Static mock** — `createOpenClawSession` returning fixed sessionId | openclaw integration | `mockImplementation((id) => ({ sessionId: id }))` |
| **Missing schema validation** — no `.refine()` for expired delegations | delegation/schemas.ts (source) | Add two `.refine()` checks |

Result: **975 tests pass, 0 failures.**

### Phase 2: Public Deployment (Mar 16)

Claude Code deployed Aegis to Vercel:

1. Created `vercel.json` with 30s function timeout for API routes
2. Linked existing `onetruehomies-projects/aegis-agent` Vercel project
3. Deployed with `vercel --prod` — build succeeded in 6 minutes
4. Verified all health endpoints:
   - `GET /api/health` — reserve state initializing
   - `GET /api/health/deep` — 6/6 components healthy (database, redis, bundler, rpc, wallet, sponsorship)
   - `POST /api/agent/cycle` — returned `SPONSOR_TRANSACTION` with confidence 0.85

**Live URL:** https://clawgas.vercel.app

### Phase 3: Contract Deployment (Mar 16)

Three contracts on Base Sepolia:

| Contract | Address | Deployer |
|---|---|---|
| AegisActivityLogger | `0xC76eaA20A3F9E074931D4B101fE59b6bf2471e97` | Previously deployed |
| AegisReactiveObserver | `0x33076cd9353d1285cb9132a94d8d062306096376` | Previously deployed |
| AegisDelegationRegistry | `0xEd4EF89E88775Ca9832706Fc7A06Fe4a596811a2` | Claude Code via `forge script` |

Claude wrote the Foundry deploy script (`script/DeployDelegationRegistry.s.sol`) and deployed using the `aegis-agent` keystore with the agent wallet as constructor argument.

## Architecture Decisions Made with AI

### 1. Agent-First Prioritization (Tier System)
**Decision:** Reject all EOA requests. Prioritize ERC-8004 registered agents (Tier 1), then ERC-4337 smart accounts (Tier 2), then generic smart contracts (Tier 3).

**Rationale (discussed with Claude):** Aegis exists to serve autonomous agents, not human wallets. EOAs can use faucets. Tiering ensures scarce gas budget goes to the most verifiable agents first.

**Implementation:** `src/lib/agent/validation/account-validator.ts` checks bytecode + ERC-8004 registry. Queue uses tier for priority dequeue.

### 2. Fail-Closed Policy Engine
**Decision:** If any policy rule throws an exception (e.g., database unavailable), the decision is REJECTED, not approved.

**Rationale:** For an autonomous gas sponsorship agent handling real funds, a permissive failure mode is unacceptable. Claude suggested wrapping each rule in a try-catch that returns `ERROR` status on exception.

### 3. EIP-712 Signed Decisions
**Decision:** Every sponsorship decision is hashed and signed by the agent wallet before execution, creating a verifiable audit trail.

**Rationale:** Enables on-chain logging via AegisActivityLogger without trusting the execution layer. The signed decision can be verified by anyone.

### 4. On-Chain Delegation Registry
**Decision:** Store delegation state off-chain (Prisma) for fast validation, but write an immutable audit trail to the on-chain `AegisDelegationRegistry`.

**Rationale:** Fast reads for the paymaster validation path, but full verifiability for disputes and compliance.

## Debugging Sessions

### TDZ Bug Pattern (Most Common)
Claude identified a systematic pattern across 4 test files: Vitest's `vi.mock()` is hoisted to the top of the module, running before any `const` declarations. When a mock factory references a `const mockFn = vi.fn()`, it hits a Temporal Dead Zone error. The fix — `vi.hoisted(() => vi.fn())` — runs the initializer at hoist time.

### Moltbook Timer Deadlock
7 tests hung for 10+ seconds each. Root cause: the skill calls `sleep(REPLY_INTERVAL_MS)` (20 seconds) between replies, and the test awaited the result synchronously. Claude's fix: use `vi.useFakeTimers()`, start the execution as a promise without awaiting, advance the clock by 100 seconds, then await the result.

### Passport Null Crash
`sponsorship-rules.ts` accessed `passport.sponsorCount` without a null check. When `getPassport()` returned null (agent not registered), the rule crashed instead of failing gracefully. Claude added `passport != null &&` to the guard expression.

## Code Sections Written by AI

Claude Code authored or substantially modified:

- **Test infrastructure:** All 16 test files fixed in Phase 1 (mocks, timers, assertions)
- **Source fixes:** `sponsorship-rules.ts` null guard, `delegation/schemas.ts` refine validations, `openclaw/parsers.ts` duration parser
- **Deployment:** `vercel.json`, `script/DeployDelegationRegistry.s.sol`
- **Policy rules:** Contributed to the fail-closed patterns in `sponsorship-rules.ts` and `approved-agent-check` rule
- **Queue consumer:** Mock architecture for `queue-consumer.test.ts` including validateAccount integration

Victor authored the core architecture, business logic, smart contracts, database schema, API routes, and frontend.

## Phase 5: Hackathon Sprint (Mar 17)

Strategic pivot: after analyzing the judging criteria, we decided to maximize on-chain footprint and verifiable output. The judges evaluate shipped artifacts, on-chain activity, and documentation quality -- not just code.

### Decision: Build AegisAttestationLogger

**Problem:** The existing AegisActivityLogger only logs sponsorships. Policy rejections, heartbeats, and agent discovery events had no on-chain footprint.

**Solution:** New contract `AegisAttestationLogger.sol` with 4 event types:
- `PolicyDecision` -- logs every approval AND rejection with reason
- `Heartbeat` -- posts liveness proof with gas price and active protocol count
- `AgentDiscovery` -- records when Aegis discovers new smart accounts
- `ReputationUpdate` -- logs reputation changes after sponsorship

**Why it matters for judges:** Shows Aegis doesn't just act -- it documents *why* it acts. Rejections are logged too, proving the safety-first approach is real, not marketing.

Claude Code wrote the contract, 11 Foundry tests (all passing), and the TypeScript integration (`src/lib/agent/execute/attestation-logger.ts`).

### Decision: Wire Everything On-Chain

Rather than keeping attestations in the database, we wired the agent orchestrator to post on-chain for:
1. **Policy decisions** (in `src/lib/agent/index.ts` after `validatePolicy()`) -- both approvals and rejections
2. **Heartbeats** (in `src/lib/agent/multi-mode-agent.ts` every 15 min) -- gas price + protocol count
3. **Reputation updates** (in `src/lib/agent/index.ts` after successful sponsorship)

**Trade-off:** More gas cost per cycle, but dramatically more on-chain artifacts for judges to verify.

### Decision: EAS Integration

EAS (Ethereum Attestation Service) on Base creates portable, verifiable attestations of the Gas Passport data. This means any protocol can check an agent's sponsorship track record without trusting Aegis's database.

Schema: `(address agent, uint256 sponsorCount, uint256 successRateBps, uint256 protocolCount, bytes32 reputationHash)`

### Decision: Multi-Agent Discovery

Created `scripts/discover-and-sponsor-agents.ts` that scans the ERC-8004 Identity Registry for recently registered agents and sponsors eligible ones. This demonstrates the "agents that cooperate" theme -- Aegis proactively helps other agents on Base.

### Decision: Remotion Video

Built a programmatic video using Remotion (React-based video framework) with 5 scenes: Hook, Problem, Architecture (ORPEM loop), Live Proof (real tx hashes), and Impact (stats + differentiators). The narration script is at `video/NARRATION_SCRIPT.md`.
